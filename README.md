# Idle-Clicker-Bakery

Brandon Parsons, Team Cookie

This is a game where the goal is to make as many cookies as you can. You can use different combinations of upgrades and buildings to try and progress as quickly as possible. 
This is a type of idle game, where you can run it in the background of whatever you are doing, or you can try to click the cookie a bunch to get the number bigger more quickly. 

Currently the plans are to have a clickable cookie, a decent looking user interface, different buildings with varying effects and prices, and upgrades that can multiply the rate of different methods of getting cookies.
The game will show your passive cookies per second in real time, as well as your current total of cookies. It will also show you how many of each building you have, and the level of each upgrade you have gotten. 

Look at the UML diagram to see how some of the different features will likely interact.
